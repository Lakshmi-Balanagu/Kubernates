2.To know more details of pod :

Rollback the Deployment to the Previous Revision:

3.Use the following command to initiate the rollback of the deployment to its previous revision:

  $kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
This command will roll back the deployment to the previous revision automatically.

Verify the Rollback:

  After performing the rollback, you can check the status of the deployment to ensure it has been rolled back successfully:
    $kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment
  You can also check the status of the pods to ensure that the previous revision is running:
    $kubectl get pods -l app=nginx-deployment
  If you want to see the list of previous revisions and their status, you can check the rollout history of the deployment using:
    $kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
  This will show you the revisions and details about each deployment, such as which changes were made.
  If you want to roll back to a specific revision (not just the previous one), you can specify the revision number like this:
    $kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment --to-revision=<revision_number>
      Replace <revision_number> with the desired revision number.
4. using kubectl command create simple name space and pods
    $kubectl run my-pod --image=my-image --namespace=my-namespace.
    $kubectl create namespace
